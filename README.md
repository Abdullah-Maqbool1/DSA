This repository includes **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** materials from my university coursework.  
The goal is to build efficient problem-solving skills, master core data structures, and apply key algorithms in real-world scenarios.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Linear Data Structures
- Arrays (1D, 2D, Dynamic)
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stack (Array & LinkedList implementation)
- Queue (Simple, Circular, Priority Queue)

### 🔹 Non-Linear Data Structures
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST)
- Tree Traversals (InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder, LevelOrder)
- Heaps (Min-Heap, Max-Heap)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix/List, Directed/Undirected)
- Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm)

### 🔹 Algorithms
- Searching (Linear, Binary)
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick)
- Hashing (Linear Probing, Chaining)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming (Intro + basic problems)

### 🔹 Applications
- DSA-based Project: **Travel Route Planner using Graphs**
- Problem-Solving on arrays, strings, sets, and maps
- Time & Space Complexity Analysis
